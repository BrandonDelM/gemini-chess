# Gemini Chess
Some things we accomplished with this project:
* Implemented Player vs bot playability.
* Linked Gemini from the backend to the frontend to play a game of chess.
* Made Gemini allow for the analysis of the game.
* Created a websocket for player vs player games
* Implemented a game history that highlights all of the prior moves of a game which can be clicked on to highlights how good a move was.
